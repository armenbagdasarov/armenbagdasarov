abstract: The ultrafast spatiotemporal dynamics of large-scale neural networks
  can be examined using resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) microstates,
  representing transient periods of synchronized neural activity that evolve
  dynamically over time. In adults, four canonical microstates have been shown
  to explain most topographic variance in resting-state EEG. Their temporal
  structures are age-, sex- and state-dependent, and are susceptible to
  pathological brain states. However, no studies have assessed the spatial and
  temporal properties of EEG microstates exclusively during early childhood, a
  critical period of rapid brain development. Here we sought to investigate EEG
  microstates recorded with high-density EEG in a large sample of 103,
  4â€“8-year-old children. Using data-driven k-means cluster analysis, we show
  that the four canonical microstates reported in adult populations already
  exist in early childhood. Using multiple linear regressions, we demonstrate
  that the temporal dynamics of two microstates are associated with age and sex.
  Source localization suggests that attention- and cognitive control-related
  networks govern the topographies of the age- and sex-dependent microstates.
  These novel findings provide unique insights into functional brain development
  in children captured with EEG microstates.
