Hello! I am a third-year Ph.D. student in clinical psychology at Duke University, where I work with Dr. Michael S. Gaffrey in the Duke Early Experience and the Developing Brain (DEED) Lab. I received my B.A. in psychology at the University of Pennsylvania in 2018. Following, I completed the two-year Sara S. Sparrow Fellowship in Clinical Neuroscience at the Yale Child Study Center. I am also a National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellow.
